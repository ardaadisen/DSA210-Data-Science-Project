Comparison of the Sum of Total Number of Passengers by Year and Metro Line  Which Managed by Istanbul Metro
Project Proposal
1. Project Motivation
Public transportation is essential for urban mobility, and the Istanbul Metro, managed by Metro Istanbul, plays a critical role in reducing congestion and providing efficient travel. This project aims to analyze and compare the total number of passengers by year and metro line to understand trends in metro usage. The key research questions include:
•	How has metro ridership evolved over the years?
•	Which metro lines have experienced the highest passenger growth?
•	How do newly opened metro lines impact ridership distribution?
The findings from this study could provide insights for urban planners and policymakers to improve metro services and predict future transportation needs.

2. Data Sources
The primary dataset for this project will be obtained from Metro Istanbul’s official passenger statistics page:
https://www.metro.istanbul/yolcuhizmetleri/yolcuistatistikleri 
This source provides annual passenger numbers for each metro line, which will be used to track changes over time.

Additional supporting datasets may be sourced from:
•	İstanbul Büyükşehir Belediyesi (İBB) Open Data Portal
https://data.ibb.gov.tr (if relevant transportation or demographic data is found)
•	TÜİK (Turkish Statistical Institute)
https://data.tuik.gov.tr (for population growth trends, which could be used for correlation analysis)

3. Data Collection Plan
The data collection process will follow these steps:
1.	Extract ridership data: Download annual metro ridership statistics from the Metro Istanbul website.
2.	Organize the data: Structure the dataset in a tabular format (CSV or JSON), including metro line names and annual passenger counts.
3.	Cross-check and enrich the data: If additional datasets (such as new metro openings or population growth statistics) are available, they will be incorporated.
4.	Prepare for analysis: Perform initial data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure consistency and completeness.
